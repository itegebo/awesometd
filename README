Awesome Tower Defense
=====================

Awesome Tower Defense is one of Trygve Vea's pet projects. It is written in
C/SDL, because C is awesome and SDL is easy. The combination makes it pretty
easy to port the game into different platforms.

It is also licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0

Developing
==========

With the current version of Autotools, autogen.sh is no longer necessary.  But
you first need to run,

autoreconf --install

Then you can do the usual,

./configure && make
